      <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly evolved from a futuristic concept into a real-world technology that powers our daily lives. From personalized recommendations on streaming platforms to advanced medical diagnostics, AI is transforming industries across the globe.</p>
      <h2>1. The Rise of Machine Learning</h2>
      <p>Machine learning allows systems to improve automatically through experience. With vast amounts of data and computational power, AI can now identify patterns and make predictions more accurately than ever before.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Recommendation engines for Netflix and Spotify</li>
        <li>Fraud detection in banking</li>
        <li>Predictive maintenance in manufacturing</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. AI in Everyday Life</h2>
      <p>From virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to self-driving cars, AI has become an integral part of our daily experience. These technologies enhance convenience, safety, and accessibility.</p>

      <h2>3. Ethical Challenges and the Future</h2>
      <p>Despite its benefits, AI raises ethical questions regarding privacy, bias, and job displacement. The future of AI depends on developing responsible systems that prioritize fairness, transparency, and human values.</p>

      <p>As AI continues to advance, it promises to unlock new possibilities — reshaping the way we live, work, and connect with the world.</p>
